# Tax Chatbot Assistant

An AI-powered chatbot designed to assist with personal and business tax-related inquiries. This chatbot leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to provide informative responses based on user queries related to tax regulations, individual income, business structures, and more.

## Example Usage

### Question about Tax Brackets for Individual Income:

**User:**
Can you explain the tax brackets for individual income in the US?

**AI Response:**
To calculate the approximate income tax, we'll use the 2021 tax brackets for married couples filing jointly:
- 10% on the first $19,900
- 12% on income between $19,901 and $81,050
- 22% on income between $81,051 and $172,750

For a $120,000 income, the tax calculation would be as follows:
- 10% on $19,900: $1,990
- 12% on ($81,050 - $19,901): $7,487.88
- 22% on ($120,000 - $81,051): $8,714.98

Summing these amounts gives a total approximate income tax liability of $18,192.86. Please note that this is a simplified calculation, and individual circumstances may affect the actual amount. For precise results, you may want to consult with a tax professional.

### Question about Business Structure:

**User:**
I would like to start a business, would I pay less tax filing as a partnership or a corporation?

**AI Response:**
To determine whether you would pay less tax filing as a partnership or a corporation, I need more information. Can you provide details about your business, such as expected profits, the number of owners, and your long-term goals?
